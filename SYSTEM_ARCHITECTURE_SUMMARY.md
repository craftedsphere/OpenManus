## Modular Design Principles

### 1. **Plugin Architecture**
- Entry point-based plugin discovery
- Dynamic loading/unloading of components
- Version management and dependency resolution
- Security validation and sandboxing

### 2. **Agent Composition**
- Agents can be composed from multiple tools
- Tool collections can be shared across agents
- Agents can be extended through inheritance
- State management and persistence

### 3. **Tool Abstraction**
- Tools are abstracted through `BaseTool`
- Tools can be local or remote (MCP)
- Tool results are standardized
- Error handling and validation

### 4. **Flow Orchestration**
- Multi-agent workflows
- Flow factory for creating different flow types
- Agent coordination and communication
- State management across agents
